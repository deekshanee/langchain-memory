      "content": " 2+2 is equal to 4. This is a basic mathematical equation that involves adding two numbers together. In this case, the numbers are both 2, so when you add them together, you get 4. This is a fundamental concept in mathematics and is often taught in early education. Is there anything else you would like to know about 2+2?",
